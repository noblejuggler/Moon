#### What lesson or moral did you take away from this person's story? How will it change you as an individual? Do you think the author wanted to teach a lesson to the reader?
I took away that if you work hard you can accomplish and overcome many things. Now knowing what can be done, I know that I am able to accomplish many things. I believe that the lesson the author wanted to teach is that To learn from your mistakes and work hard. The author knows that if he explains his situations, people will be able to learn from them.

#### As the book is written, it is told from the point of view of the narrator. Identify the main conflict in the text. Explain some of the different opinions expressed about this main conflict and analyze why that person would have a different opinion on the conflict?
 The main conflict is that the three characters want to become doctors but it is expressed by others in their neighborhood that no one makes it out of there. The three characters believe that is possible but it will take hard work. Others may see the situation differently because that's what they have seen and thought for so long. But now that the three have become doctors, others may see things in a different light.
#### As the author's write, they use various literary elements to draw the reader in and enhance the reading experience. Identify two different literary elements the author used (imagery, symbolism, foreshadowing, irony, allusion, use of figurative language, mood/ tone or point of view) and explain how the use of these literary elements enhanced the book.
 I noticed the use of foreshadowing when the author takes a brief second to explain what is happening in the text and then tells us that it will have some sort of outcome later. This happens a few times throughout the text but for the most part it might go over the reader's head. I also noticed the use of imagery throughout the text when they switch locations, they give you a brief description of what the place felt and looked like. This helps the reader understand how to feel about the situation that the characters will get in later. It also helps the reader understand how the characters may feel.
#### If your author was a superhero, which one would they be? Why? what superpower would they have?
 Sam Davis would be Spider-Man because he grew up being a pretty smart child. He then grew up to save lives which is what Peter Parker did as well
#### Identify a current, modern day conflict that mirrors the issue the author preserved through. Explain how these two issues are similar and different.
 Gang violence today is the the same if not worse today. Granted there may be as many but they are still getting even more dangerous with the new weapons being developed. Some gangs are bale to get their hands on them. Back then, gangs had many weapons but not as dangerous. But in some ways they are still the same. They still take lives and deal drugs. So it really hasn't changed that much even though we like to say that it has.
